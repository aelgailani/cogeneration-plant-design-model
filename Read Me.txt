
The EMB model is a model I built during my first employment with KETS in order to 
expedite the design process of cogeneration plants in sugar factories. I made it to
study the optimum (in terms of costs and mechanical performance)set up and main 
parameters (e.g. boiler pressure and temperature). I was planning to incorporate 
the economic aspects of the design (e.g. prices, fixed costs, running costs, 
depreciation, etc.) to make a thermo-economic model that helps in selecting the most 
feasible decisions, but unfortunately there was no available data.


Notes:
In order to be able to run the model properly, you have to add steam properties 
formulas as an add-in in your excel. To do so, please follow the steps below:
 1- place the folder (EMB Model) in Desktop
 2- open any Excel file and go to File -> Options -> Add-Ins
 3- click on "Go" button next to "Manage", and make sure that "add-ins" is 
selected in the drop down list is
 4- click "browse" and go to the folder in the Desktop and choose Steam_Tables then click OK
 5-check the box of steam_tables.
 6- now open the file (EMB Model) and click on continue. don’t click on edit links.
 6- click on "find and select" in Home tab in the ribbon, select “replace”
 7- copy this text:  'C:\Users\Ahmed\Desktop\EMB Model\Steam_Tables.xlam'!    and paste it in "find what" textbox
leave "replace with" blank and click on "replace all" then ok. Now the sheet should work properly. 
If you there is nothing to replace then the sheet is already OK.
